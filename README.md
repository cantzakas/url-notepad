# URL Notepad

Time and time again, I've found myself in need to save webpage URLs I come across for future reference or for later reading. Over time, I also wanted to share this list with selected people. Eventually, this list has grown long enough to be shared with the greater community. 

So here it is, my list of URLs, anything ranging from technical topics I am interested at to articles on people, social, communication skills, Diversity and LGBTQI+.
